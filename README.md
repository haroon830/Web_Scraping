# Web Scraping using Shell scripting


To execute the webscrape.sh file, follow these steps:

Open the webscrape.sh file in a text editor.
Locate line 21, which contains the emailurl variable.
Replace the placeholder link with the URL of the website you want to scrape.
Save the changes to the webscrape.sh file.
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where the webscrape.sh file is located.
Run the following command: ./webscrape.sh
The script will begin scraping the website, extracting HTML, CSS, images, etc.
Once the scraping is complete, the script will separate emails, links, and names from the scraped website data.
